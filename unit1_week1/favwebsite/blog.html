	<h1>My favorite websites</h1>
	<h4 class="title">Twitter</h4>
	<p class="content">Twitter has a wonderful user interface in that the newest tweets draws attention first, which is the most important area of the website. Also the box where you put your tweet is easy to catch attention. <br/> This website is fairly simple and beautifully composed.
	</p>

	<h4 class="title">KitKat</h4>
	<p class="content">KitKat webpage is amazing in that the images of the products catch our attention the most, which the seller should intend to. Also they are displayed in a joyful way, floating, which makes users feel happy and want to eat chocolates.
	</p>
	<h4 class="title">Apple</h4>
	<p class="content">Apple webpage is artistic in that it has only one page long on the top page, which makes the entire site look very simple. Like Kitkat webpage, this webpage also has spectacle images of its products, which draws our attention. I also notice that using images as backgrounds is effective to make the webpage look nicer and more beautiful.</p>
